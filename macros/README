Set your preferences in runsim.C and run it:

> root -l -q runsim.C

runsim.C will call macro simall.C, and will create the output test.root with the TTree.


After that, you can visualize your simulation. Just run evtvis.C:

> root -l evtvis.C


For a simple data analysis, you can take the example of macro checkResults.C. Just run that:

> root -l checkResults.C
